In a time of global crisis
An international task force of heroes
Banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world
The organisation known as Overwatch ended the crisis
And helped maintain peace for the generation
But over many years, Overwatch's influence waned and it was eventually disbanded
Now in the wake of its dismantling, conflict is rising once again
Overwatch may be gone but the world still needs its heroes

Danger! It's the Widowmaker, she handles more stiffs than an undertaker
D.Va, she can pilot a mech, but she can’t purchase alcohol legally yet
Genji, so kawaii sexy. Onitsuka, Ku, Ju and other Japanese words
Reinhardt, he’s a German knight, he’s got a massive hammer so think twice before a fight

Tracer! You know they say she's a clutz, but you've got to admit she's got a really nice bbaaaa
Bastion! He's a star attraction! A metallic contraption with a birdy companion
Reaper! Never misses a trick, but I heard on the grapevine he's got a really tiny little...
Winston! Stay out of the way this peanut butter loving monkey will ruin your day

The World Still Needs Heroes
You, Me and Overwatch

McCree! Do you feel lucky punk? He’s a gun toting six shooting badass hunk
Pharah! It's a bird or a plane? No, it’s a rocket launching jump jetting Egyptian dame
Mei, she looks really nice, but under the suit and smile she’s as cold as ice!
Torbjörn, he’s a Viking blacksmith, we thought he was a dwarf but turns out that was a myth

Lucio, his last album was shit, but so is this song and we're not a bunch of hypocrites
Soldier: 76, he isn't that old, but he's still pretty old
Zarya! The definition of a tank, I often think about her when I'm having a private...
Hanzo! Oh no he’s aiming at you, Ryuu ga, waga teki wo kurau!
