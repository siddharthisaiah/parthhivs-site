	[Intro]
	Brothers of the mine rejoice!
	Swing, swing, swing with me
	Raise your pick and raise your voice!
	Sing, sing, sing with me
	Down and down into the deep
	Who knows what we'll find beneath?
	Diamonds, rubies, gold, and more
	Hidden in the mountain store
	
	[Bridge 1]
	Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
	Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
	Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
	To dig and dig makes us free
	Come on, brothers, sing with me!
	
	[Chorus]
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole
	
	[Verse 1]
	The sunlight will not reach this low
	Deep, deep in the mine
	Never seen the blue moon glow
	Dwarves won't fly so high
	Fill a glass and down some mead
	Stuff your bellies at the feast!
	Stumble home and fall asleep
	Dreaming in our mountain keep
	
	[Bridge 2]
	Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb
	The Earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tomb
	Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom
	We do not fear what lies beneath, we can never dig too deep
	
	[Chorus]
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole
	
	[Bridge 3]
	Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
	Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
	Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
	To dig and dig makes us free
	Come on, brothers, sing with me
	
	[Chorus]
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
	I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
	Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole
